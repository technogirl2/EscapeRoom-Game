The initial scope of this project, as outlined in our project report, encompassed the following key elements:
Objective: Our goal is to create an escape room game that is inclusive for all and provides an immersive and engaging game experience and fosters problem-solving and critical thinking skills for players.
     
 Features and Functionalities:
- We aimed to create an escape room game that has four different rooms with different themes (crime, prison, future, and zombie).
- Design Save/ Load Game functionalities
- Integrate timer, restart, and reset game features
- The player needs to click on the clue objects and play 4 mini
games (crime, prison, future and zombie themes) to pass
through to the next room.
- Include Audio description, room description, room images,
and motor control for inclusivity and accessibility of users.
Additions:
- Adding new user stories numbered 22, 23, 24, and 25 that include features such as View MiniGame Clue Answer that enhances player’s experience
Exclusion:
- Exclude user stories numbered 3, 9, 11, 12, 21 to prioritize
other important user stories.
Refinement:
- Combine user stories Room Images(4) and Room Description(5).
- Adding new branch such as Instruction(16) to resolve any merge conflict

Rationale:
The decision to add additional user stories to eliminate some of our less-priority user stories is due to time constraints. This ensures our game can be finished and has the most important features in a short amount of time.
Impact:
The addition of new user stories greatly improves our user interface and game functionality, enhancing the user experience. Furthermore, the removal of some user stories also simplifies the project, ensuring our game can be finished on time and meet the user’s expectations.
